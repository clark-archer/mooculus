<h3>Fundamental theorem of calculus</h3>

<p>After putting in so much work, we finally reap our reward:
<strong>the fundamental theorem of calculus.</strong>  The
antidifferentiation from <a
href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=Week10">Week 10</a> and the
integration from <a
href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=Week11">Week 11</a> combine this week,
in a single theorem.  You might be wondering:  <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/305"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;what is the big deal about the fundamental
theorem of calculus?</a>  The big deal is that we can <strong>evaluate
integrals by finding antiderivatives</strong> and the latter operation
of antidifferentiation is much easier than the Riemann sum business.</p>

<p>More than anything else this week, I want to make sure you have an understanding of <em>why</em> the
fundamental theorem of calculus is true, so we'll see the theorem from
a few different perspectives; if you're looking for more computational
practice, we'll do plenty more during <a
href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=Week13">Week 13</a>.</p>
<p>And there's one more week to finish the midterm: please <a href="/calc1-001/forum/index">post a message to the
forum</a> if you're having any trouble with the midterm, or talk with
me during  <a href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=OfficeHours">Office
Hours</a> on March 29, 2013 at 10:30AM EDT.</p>

<h3>What is the fundamental theorem of calculus?</h3>

<p>The <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus">fundamental
theorem of calculus</a> comes in a couple forms.  In the <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/307"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;first version of the theorem</a>, we learn
that the derivative of the accumulation function is the original
function.  More explicitly, suppose $$f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$$ is
continuous, and define $$F$$ by the rule $$F(x) =
\displaystyle\int_a^x f(t) \, dt$$.  Then $$F$$ is continuous on
$$[a,b]$$ and differentiable on $$(a,b)$$ and $$F'(x) = f(x)$$.</p>
<p>You can play around with <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/wiggleInputIntegral"><i
class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;how wiggling the endpoints of
integration affects the integral on mooculus</a>.  The fundamental
theorem is presented on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;203
of the Textbook</a>.</p>

<h3>How am I supposed to use the fundamental theorem?</h3>

<p>In what is often called the <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/309"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;second version of the fundamental
theorem</a>, we learn that if, say, $$f$$ is continuous and $$F$$ is
an antiderivative of $$f$$, then $$\displaystyle\int_a^b f(x) \, dx =
F(b) - F(a)$$.  In other words, evaluating an integral amounts to
taking the difference of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints; you can <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/definiteIntegralBasic"><i
class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;practice evaluating integrals using the
fundamental theorem on mooculus</a>.</p>

<p>The second version of the fundamental
theorem of calculus is presented on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;205
of the Textbook</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, <strong>you can see some examples worked
out.</strong>  We can use the fundamental theorem to <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/313"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;evaluate $$\displaystyle\int_0^\pi \sin x \,
dx$$</a> and to <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/315"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;evaluate $$\displaystyle\int_0^1 x^4 \,
dx$$</a>  

<h3>What else can we compute this way?</h3>

<p>Integrals are calculating &ldquo;(signed!) area under the
curve&rdquo; but you can also use them to calculate area between two
curves.  For instance, we can <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/317"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;compute the area between the graph of $$y
= \sqrt{x}$$ and $$y = x^2$$,</a> and we can <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/319"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;compute the area between the graph of $$y
= x^2$$ and $$y = 1-x^2$$.</a></p>

<p>We can also play around with the <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/321"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;accumulation function for a
semicircle $$y = \sqrt{1-x^2}$$</a>, which is a great example: we can find the accumulation
function by doing some geometry, and also verify that the derivative
of the accumulation is $$\sqrt{1-x^2}$$, that is, we can
&ldquo;see&rdquo; that the fundamental theorem is true in this
case.</p>

<h3>But why is the fundamental theorem true?</h3>

<p>There are a few different perspectives I'd like to present.</p>

<p>We already used the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler method</a> to
numerically approximate antiderivatives.  Not coincidentally, <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/323"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;the method of Euler looks a lot like a
Riemann sum,</a> which makes sense: the Riemann sum is approximating
the accumulation function, which is an antiderivative!</p>

<p>Second, there's an <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/325"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;analogy between summation and
integration.</a>  We can <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/325"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;use this analogy to compute
$$\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^k n^4$$,</a> so if you believe that you can
evaluate sums by &ldquo;antidifferencing&rdquo; you might believe you
can evaluate integrals by antidifferentiating!</p>

<p>Finally, we can <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/331"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;rephrase the fundamental theorem as a
physical statement about velocity,</a> which makes it a bit more
intuitive: the accumulation function of velocity is computing total displacement,
and differentiating displacement is velocity, so it's again, the
fundamental theorem!</p>

<p>We'll end the week by <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/329"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;considering
$$\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx} \displaystyle\int_x^b f(t) \, dt$$,</a>
which gives us a chance to review the fundamental theorem yet again.</p>
